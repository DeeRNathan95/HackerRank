Given the radius , we calculate the following:

We then print  as our first line of output and  as our second line of output.

============================================================================
Solution;
function main() {
    // Write your code here. Read input using 'readLine()' and print output using 'console.log()'.
    
    // Print the area of the circle:
    
    // Print the perimeter of the circle:
     const PI = Math.PI;
    
    // Example of reading the input (radius) - assuming input is provided in a competitive environment
    let radius = parseFloat(readLine());  // `readLine()` is typically used in competitive platforms like HackerRank
    
    // Calculate the area of the circle: Area = PI * radius^2
    let area = PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
    
    // Calculate the perimeter of the circle (circumference): Perimeter = 2 * PI * radius
    let perimeter = 2 * PI * radius;
    
    // Print the area of the circle (first line)
    console.log(area);
    
    // Print the perimeter of the circle (second line)
    console.log(perimeter);

Breakdown explaination:
Let's break this down step by step, and I'll explain it like we're learning it for the first time:

### 1. **`const PI = Math.PI;`**
   - **What is `const`?**: It means we’re creating a **constant** variable that won't change.
   - **What is `PI`?**: `PI` is a special number in math, which is approximately 3.14159. It's the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
   - **`Math.PI`**: This is JavaScript’s way of giving us the value of PI (which is roughly 3.14159).
   
   So, this line sets `PI` to 3.14159 (or a very close approximation).

### 2. **`let radius = parseFloat(readLine());`**
   - **`let`**: This is used to create a variable that can change its value.
   - **`readLine()`**: This function reads the user’s input. Think of it as asking, “What’s the radius of your circle?” and waiting for you to answer.
   - **`parseFloat()`**: This converts the input (which is usually a **string** like `"2.6"`) into a **number** (like `2.6`). We use `parseFloat()` because we need the radius as a number to do math with it.

   So, this line:
   - Reads the radius input from the user.
   - Converts that input into a number.
   - Stores that number in the variable `radius`.

### 3. **`let area = PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);`**
   - **What’s this doing?** It’s calculating the **area of the circle**.
   - **Formula for area of a circle**: The formula is `PI * radius^2`. This means we multiply PI by the square of the radius.
   - **`Math.pow(radius, 2)`**: This is the JavaScript way of saying “square the radius” (multiply the radius by itself).
     - So, if `radius = 3`, then `Math.pow(3, 2)` is `3 * 3 = 9`.
   - Finally, we multiply the result by `PI`.

   So, this line calculates the **area** of the circle and stores it in the `area` variable.

### 4. **`let perimeter = 2 * PI * radius;`**
   - **What’s this doing?** It’s calculating the **perimeter (or circumference) of the circle**.
   - **Formula for perimeter of a circle**: The formula is `2 * PI * radius`.
   - So, we’re multiplying the radius by `2`, and then multiplying by `PI` to get the perimeter.

   This line calculates the **perimeter** (the distance around the edge of the circle) and stores it in the `perimeter` variable.

### 5. **`console.log(area);`**
   - **What is `console.log()`?**: This prints whatever is inside the parentheses to the screen.
   - **`console.log(area)`**: This prints the **area** of the circle, which we calculated earlier.

### 6. **`console.log(perimeter);`**
   - **`console.log(perimeter)`**: This prints the **perimeter** of the circle, which we also calculated.

### Let’s put it all together:
1. **We define `PI`**, which is 3.14159 (the number used for circles).
2. **We ask for the radius** of the circle and convert it to a number.
3. **We calculate the area** using the formula `PI * radius^2`.
4. **We calculate the perimeter** using the formula `2 * PI * radius`.
5. **We print both the area and perimeter** so we can see the results.

### Example:
If the user enters `3` as the radius:
- **Area**: `3.14159 * 3 * 3 = 28.27` (approximately).
- **Perimeter**: `2 * 3.14159 * 3 = 18.85` (approximately).

You’ll see both numbers printed on the screen!
